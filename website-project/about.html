    <h3>Colonies</h3>
    <p>
      A typical ant colony contains an egg-laying queen and many (female) adult
      workers together with their brood (eggs, larvae and pupae). Although the
      workers are sterile and they cannot reproduce, they are responsible for
      nest construction and maintenance, foraging, tending the brood and queen,
      and nest defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queens are distinguished mainly by the size of their bodies. They also
      live much longer than workers and often have wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Males are generally about the same size as the workers or smaller, and
      have smaller heads with large ocelli, very short scapes and small
      mandibles. In many cases males look more like wasps than ants.

    <p class="smaller-text">The "Mesoma" in the image is a typo.</p>
    <p>Explanation of some terms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Mesosoma</b> or <b>Alitrunk</b>: Like all insects, an ant's body is
        divided into three main parts: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen.
        The mesosoma contains the muscles for flying and running, and serves the
        same function as the thorax.
      </li>
      <li><b>Petiole</b>: The ant's "waist"</li>
      <li><b>Ocelli</b>: Light sensitive eye-spots</li>
      <li>
        <b>Gaster</b>: The gaster contains the ant's heart, digestive system,
        and chemical weaponry. It serves the same function as the abdomen. The
        tip of the gaster is where you find the sting, or perhaps an acidopore,
        which can squirt out acidic irritant.
